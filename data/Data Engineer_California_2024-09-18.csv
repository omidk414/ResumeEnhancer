Pendulum® is leading a revolution that is occurring around the world to improve physical and mental health by first understanding, then restoring and enhancing the human microbiome.

Studies have shown that our microbiome (the bacterial communities in and on our bodies) is linked to everything from metabolism and diabetes, to longevity, weight loss, healthy immune systems, cancer prevention, feelings of well-being, inflammatory bowel disease, and even healthy skin. We have just scratched the surface on understanding the impact that our microbiome has on our lives. During early life we develop a diverse and balanced microbiome that plays a critical role in shaping our long-term health. Over our lives, a combination of diet, lifestyle, antibiotics, and aging can decrease the effectiveness of our microbiome.

Pendulum recognized the enormous impact they could have on people’s lives if they were able to address the imbalances in the microbiome. To accomplish this, Pendulum created proprietary probiotic pipelines and a unique discovery platform to identify key, novel bacterial strains and the prebiotics that feed them. The company has also built and developed the world’s first manufacturing technology to produce bacteria in an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment at scale.

The medical probiotics that Pendulum has formulated have transformed the consumer probiotics market into a new category of therapeutic offerings that deliver the power and efficacy of a pharmaceutical with the safety and accessibility of a natural probiotic. Due to Pendulum’s explosive revenue and customer growth over the last two years, the company earned a spot on Forbes Magazine’s exclusive “The Next Billion Dollar Startups” list.

We’re also especially proud of our award-winning culture and our regular appearance on those “Best Places to Work” lists.
We are a company filled with people who are passionate about our product and seek to deliver the best experience for our customers and users.

We want to combine this customer value, with building great products, having fun, and importantly, delivering success as a team.

So bring your work experience, problem-solving skills and talent, of course, but also bring your joy, your passion and all the things that make you, you. Because when you feel free to be you, it makes it a lot easier for us to be us.
Role:
As a Distinguished Engineer focusing on Storage & Indexing technology, you will be diving both deep and broad across the Splunk architecture and involved in all key products we ship while being the domain expert in the storage and indexing layer. Your primary role will be to ensure the Splunk indexing and storage architecture, as exposed through the main Splunk Enterprise product, are evolving to meet the scaling considerations of our largest customersThis role will navigate the complexity of the Splunk Enterprise install base to deliver an architecture and evolution of our technology to support our largest business priorities. This software runs in both air-gapped customer managed environments, to fully SaaS cloud environments, and those that span both.

This isn’t an architectural astronaut role - you will be expected to get deep enough into the system to write and review production code. Your designs and direction should be grounded in the reality of the code, not the boxes in a presentation. At the same time, this isn’t a solo programmer role - you will be expected to lead, to present to executive audiences, and to influence the broader organization in alignment with Platform priorities.
In short, you will be the connector between the business strategy and the technical strategy, and have a direct impact on the success of Splunk in the coming decade.
This role requires a technically minded and outcome focused leader who can lead large teams of engineers effectively through being approachable, humble, and very technically deep.
Day to day life in this role will include:
Conducting architectural reviews of designs affecting not only the Data Platform area, but the across dependent peer teams as part of the DE team. The goal of these reviews is to simultaneously hold a high architectural bar while also providing a safe environment for critique and learning.
Partnering with Product leads to match strategic product vision with engineering reality
Creating architectural designs with the clarity for the organization to see the destination, but with enough space for other engineers to help build the details.
Partnering with engineering and technical leaders to ensure efficient execution of the teams.
One-on-one coaching and mentoring of engineers both inside and outside your teams.
Diving deep into the codebase on your own non-critical-path coding projects.
Code reviews, to both guide engineers and set a high standard for quality.
Responsibilities:
The responsibilities of this role include:
Working with and understanding the Splunk architecture and product, in depth and in all deployment modes.
Deep understanding of the development experience for line engineers in your areas of ownership.
Understanding the business context in which we operate, and the current strengths and limitations of our system within that context.
Building and executing a strategic technical plan for the future of the Data Platform technology area, that both builds on the technology that makes Splunk unique while tactically dropping the technical debt accrued.
Partnering with Product and Engineering Leads to ensure the technology and organization matches the needs of the product strategy long term.
Mentoring and teaching other engineers through both one-on-one and in large team meetings.
Grounding your understanding of customer needs through regular discussion with customers and the field. While you’re not in a product management or customer facing role, you will need to partner with customers and non-Engineering counterparts regularly.
Requirements:
Please note that the following requirements are flexible and should be viewed as guidelines rather than strict criteria. We understand that no candidate may meet every qualification listed.
We anticipate that the skills, competencies, and experiences outlined below will generally align with someone who has approximately 15-20 years of experience in building large software systems.

Required: Strong knowledge of how data intensive applications are constructed and run efficiently.
Required: Experience leading diverse teams across multiple locations
Required: Strong software development experience across large codebases
Required: Knowledge of indexing & storage technology
Preferred: Best practices and state of the art for delivering software both on-premise and in the cloud. This role could be considered living in the Hybrid space, so both are important.
Preferred: Experience leading large scale change (of mindsets, technologies, or tooling) in codebases and organizations.
Preferred: Microservices and monolith based development
Preferred: Web protocols and distributed systems
Competencies:
Helping people grow their skills and abilities to meet their career goals

Distinguished Engineer-Data Platforms,Splunk,California,Estimated: $119K - $151K a year,"Distinguished Engineer-Data Platforms
Location: Remote West Coast Hours
A little about us
Splunk is here to build a safer and more resilient digital world. We’re proud to say that we’re the key to enterprise resilience for more than 11,000 enterprise organizations that use our Unified Security and Observability Platform to keep their systems secure and reliable. We’re also especially proud of our award-winning culture and our regular appearance on those “Best Places to Work” lists.
We are a company filled with people who are passionate about our product and seek to deliver the best experience for our customers and users. At Splunk, we’re committed to our strong sense of purpose to deliver ""aha"" moments for our customers with their data. We want to combine this customer value, with building great products, having fun, and importantly, delivering success as a team.
If you end up joining us, we’ll only ask you one thing: bring your whole, authentic self, what we call your million data points. So bring your work experience, problem-solving skills and talent, of course, but also bring your joy, your passion and all the things that make you, you. Because when you feel free to be you, it makes it a lot easier for us to be us.
Role:
As a Distinguished Engineer focusing on Storage & Indexing technology, you will be diving both deep and broad across the Splunk architecture and involved in all key products we ship while being the domain expert in the storage and indexing layer. Your primary role will be to ensure the Splunk indexing and storage architecture, as exposed through the main Splunk Enterprise product, are evolving to meet the scaling considerations of our largest customersThis role will navigate the complexity of the Splunk Enterprise install base to deliver an architecture and evolution of our technology to support our largest business priorities. This software runs in both air-gapped customer managed environments, to fully SaaS cloud environments, and those that span both. It scales down to gigabytes of data across a single machine, to many Petabytes per day across thousands.
This role partners deeply with peer leadership made up of other Distinguished Engineers, Senior Directors, and Vice Presidents across organizations to set the strategic direction for Splunk Platform and holding teams accountable for executing on the plan. As a leader in this role you will need to be an expert at influencing without authority, engaging with peer leaders to align product-wide strategies.
This isn’t an architectural astronaut role - you will be expected to get deep enough into the system to write and review production code. Your designs and direction should be grounded in the reality of the code, not the boxes in a presentation. At the same time, this isn’t a solo programmer role - you will be expected to lead, to present to executive audiences, and to influence the broader organization in alignment with Platform priorities.
In short, you will be the connector between the business strategy and the technical strategy, and have a direct impact on the success of Splunk in the coming decade.
This role requires a technically minded and outcome focused leader who can lead large teams of engineers effectively through being approachable, humble, and very technically deep.
Day to day life in this role will include:
Conducting architectural reviews of designs affecting not only the Data Platform area, but the across dependent peer teams as part of the DE team. The goal of these reviews is to simultaneously hold a high architectural bar while also providing a safe environment for critique and learning.
Partnering with Product leads to match strategic product vision with engineering reality
Creating architectural designs with the clarity for the organization to see the destination, but with enough space for other engineers to help build the details.
Partnering with engineering and technical leaders to ensure efficient execution of the teams.
One-on-one coaching and mentoring of engineers both inside and outside your teams.
Diving deep into the codebase on your own non-critical-path coding projects.
Code reviews, to both guide engineers and set a high standard for quality.
Responsibilities:
The responsibilities of this role include:
Working with and understanding the Splunk architecture and product, in depth and in all deployment modes.
Deep understanding of the development experience for line engineers in your areas of ownership.
Understanding the business context in which we operate, and the current strengths and limitations of our system within that context.
Building and executing a strategic technical plan for the future of the Data Platform technology area, that both builds on the technology that makes Splunk unique while tactically dropping the technical debt accrued.
Partnering with Product and Engineering Leads to ensure the technology and organization matches the needs of the product strategy long term.
Mentoring and teaching other engineers through both one-on-one and in large team meetings.
Grounding your understanding of customer needs through regular discussion with customers and the field. While you’re not in a product management or customer facing role, you will need to partner with customers and non-Engineering counterparts regularly.
Requirements:
Please note that the following requirements are flexible and should be viewed as guidelines rather than strict criteria. We understand that no candidate may meet every qualification listed.
We anticipate that the skills, competencies, and experiences outlined below will generally align with someone who has approximately 15-20 years of experience in building large software systems. However, we recognize that years of experience are merely a proxy for the depth of knowledge, abilities, and hands-on expertise that a candidate may bring to the role.
Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:
Required: Strong knowledge of how data intensive applications are constructed and run efficiently.
Required: Experience leading diverse teams across multiple locations
Required: Strong software development experience across large codebases
Required: Knowledge of indexing & storage technology
Preferred: Best practices and state of the art for delivering software both on-premise and in the cloud. This role could be considered living in the Hybrid space, so both are important.
Preferred: Experience leading large scale change (of mindsets, technologies, or tooling) in codebases and organizations.
Preferred: Microservices and monolith based development
Preferred: Web protocols and distributed systems
Competencies:
Helping people grow their skills and abilities to meet their career goals

"Senior Software Engineer, Data, Science",Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,"Redwood City, CA",Estimated: $113K - $143K a year,"The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded by Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015 to help solve some of society's toughest challenges — from eradicating disease and improving education to addressing the needs of our local communities. Our mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone.
The Team
Founded by Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a new kind of philanthropy that's leveraging technology to help solve some of society's toughest challenges – from eradicating disease, to improving education.
