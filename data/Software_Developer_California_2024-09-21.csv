Sr. Infrastructure Engineer,Bigeye,California,Estimated: $143K - $181K a year,"The Company
Bigeye is on a mission to help enterprises trust their data. When used effectively, data can create magical experiences in services and products we all use every day. But those experiences suffer whenever data is delayed, missing, or low quality. Nearly every major enterprise still struggles to keep their data pipelines reliable and to maintain data quality, and can no longer afford to sift through a mess of manually created data quality rules.
Some of the world’s largest enterprises—like Centene, Kenvue, and Williams-Sonoma—have realized they need a more scalable approach, and now use Bigeye’s industry-leading data observability platform to keep their mission critical data applications running smoothly. Our unmatched support for enterprise-oriented data sources, and industry-leading data lineage capabilities, give us a unique foundation from which to serve enterprise data teams.
The scale of this challenge is incredibly exciting: we already check over 2 million data quality attributes every day for our customers, but estimate that only 2% of the addressable market has made the switch to using data observability.
Come join us in the journey to serve the other 98%.
You’ll be joining the infra team at Bigeye, joining a powerhouse team of engineers, product managers, product designers, data scientists, and enterprise sales folks. You’ll help us build and deliver products that customers love using.
The Work
Today, we’re focused on one of the most painful aspects of DataOps: observability and outages.
Most teams still discover data outages – duplicated, missing, and unexpected data – after they impact application features, dashboards, ML models, and ultimately, their stakeholders. We’re building a data observability platform to monitor their data content and alert them early so they can triage and reply instantly.
What you’ll be doing
Build a deployment system that will orchestrate hybrid application deployments on our AWS cloud and customer clouds
Build out and maintain our CI/CD infrastructure to enable developers to collaborate and ship their code to production regularly, quickly, and dependably
Own the infrastructure needed to allow Bigeye to scale to meet its customer demand
Automate your own manual processes to allow developers to get their work on on their own without a direct dependency on the infra team
Design and build systems and processes to improve and track the reliability of our systems
Gather, assess, and create visualizations of metrics from our applications to monitor performance and identify problems
Participate in system design and capacity planning for our services
Meet directly with Bigeye’s customer base to understand their needs and enable them to use the product
We’re currently working with
AWS CLI
Bash
Docker
Cloudformation
ECS
Fargate
Terraform
Python
What You Bring
5+ years of experience as a software engineer or as an infrastructure engineer
3+ years of experience as a software developer - you’ve spent time on the “other side of the fence”
Experience programming in at least one of Java, Go, or Python
Experience working with a Service Oriented Architecture in a cloud environment
Experience working in AWS
Experience with CI/CD processes
Proven passion for uncovering and unraveling the real customer problems
Excitement about being an early team member
Clear and straightforward communication. We’ll be building some intricate products as a team, so clarity matters.
Nice to haves
Kubernetes experience
GCP, Azure experience
AWS Networking mastery (gateways, route tables, NAT, etc)
Experience working with hybrid deploys
Experience working with modern observability tools
Bigeye aims to treat real problems for real data teams using boring technology. Success comes from building great products that address real obstacles for customers, not from satisfying our own technical curiosities.

Salary Expectations
Base salary of $190,000-$200,000, depending on experience

Benefits
Generous salary and equity opportunity
Remote first - Live where you want in the US
Flexible PTO to have fun and recharge

Even more important than your resume is a clear demonstration of impact, initiative, and the aptitude to thrive in a collaborative environment. Bigeye aspires to have an inclusive work environment; so if you are hard working & good at what you do then please come as you are.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
