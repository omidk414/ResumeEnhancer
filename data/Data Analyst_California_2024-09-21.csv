Demonstrates good judgment in selecting methods and techniques for obtaining solutions.

Involves technical expertise for planning and performing correlative analyses of biomarker and clinical data from the endocrine optimization pilot EOP I-SPY 2 sub-study trial, as well as the I-SPY suite of trials.

Specifically, the EOP I-SPY 2 sub-study trial evaluates the feasibility of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy +/- novel agents in molecularly low risk (but clinically high risk) HR+HER2- patients who screened out of the main I-SPY 2 trial. As a secondary aim, many biomarkers (expression-based, imaging, circulating, pathology-based, etc) are collected, such that correlative studies can be performed. In addition, organoids are generated from tissue samples from selected patients in collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Rosenbluth for single cell sequencing and in vitro treatment sensitivity assays. The portfolio of biomarkers is expected to grow; and dedicated bioinformatics support for performing correlative and integrative biomarker analyses to better understand the biology of endocrine responsiveness is needed.

The incumbent will provide bioinformatics and statistical support for EOP and other I-SPY studies, on a variety of projects assessing correlation between biomarkers evaluated at baseline and longitudinally to characterize patient endocrine therapy response. Work with trial investigators and the sponsor’s biometrics team to support development and timely execution of bioinformatics and statistical analysis plans for collaborative studies that leverages biomarker and clinical data from the trial to address clinically and/or translationally relevant questions. Generate reports and presentations to communicate findings to a diverse audience of clinicians, bioinformaticians, statisticians and patient advocates. Support preparation of manuscripts based on findings. Assist in planning of amendments to the EOP sub-study based on findings as needed.

Department Description
The UCSF Breast Care Center (BCC) is a nationally recognized leader in breast cancer research. A unit within the Division of Surgical Oncology, in the Department of Surgery, the BCC's clinicians are actively engaged in studies to advance all aspects of breast care including prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and improving quality of life. Our multidisciplinary team of surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, psychologists, nutritionists, and pathologists work with patients to help coordinate care to ensure that all of their concerns are thoroughly addressed. Our mission is to develop an innovative setting that will ensure that a patient’s sense of comfort and participation are central in delivering the best care possible. The integration with scientists of the Breast Oncology Program ensures the access to state of the art scientific knowledge. The BCC is also engaged in designing new processes for health care delivery, customized to the needs of individual breast cancer patients. The BCC Research Program employs 50+ full-time faculty and staff, as well as associated subcontractors and consultants.

The I-SPY Program (managed within the BCC) is a series of large scale, international projects with the goal to drive innovation in breast cancer treatment and drug approval process. I-SPY involves novel trial designs in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to accelerate the drug development process. Our goal is to introduce and rapidly test novel targeted strategies for women at high risk for recurrence, at the time of primary cancer diagnosis, rather than waiting until they develop metastatic disease. Neoadjuvant therapy allows visualization of tumor response to treatment, and thus is the ideal platform to identify mechanisms of resistance, develop diagnostic markers, and individualize therapy. The program is currently comprised of three major initiatives, a nationwide phase 1 program, and two international networks (one for phase 2 drug screening trials and one for phase 3 confirmatory trials). I-SPY is a unique public/private partnership between QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), patient advocates and over 40 major cancer research centers across the United States and Canada. The I-SPY Program Management Office, which handles executive and administrative tasks for the I-SPY Program, operates within the UCSF Breast Care Center.
