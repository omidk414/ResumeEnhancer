"Research Scientist - CoT, Science of Deep Learning",OpenAI,"San Francisco, CA",Estimated: $157K - $199K a year,"Chain-of-thought Interpretability Team - Research Science and Engineering
Monitoring models for misaligned or dangerous behavior is a crucial mitigation to our mission of bringing safe artificial general intelligence to the world. We have long been excited by the prospect of monitoring our models’ latent thinking in addition to outputs that users see; however, until recently that latent thinking has only been available in the form of activations – large blocks of illegible numbers from which we have only been able to extract simple concepts. With the advent of models that rely heavily on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, we now have access to some of the models’ internal thinking in a far more legible form and could allow us to monitor their latent thinking for more complex behavior.
The Chain-of-thought Interpretability Team, part of OpenAI’s Science of Deep Learning team, is working on technical approaches to determine whether model CoTs are monitorable, i.e. when they are faithful and legible, and what interventions may improve or degrade monitorability.

About the Role
In this role, you will develop innovative machine learning techniques and collaborate with peers across the organization to advance this critical pillar of OpenAI’s mission. We are looking for people who want to discover simple, generalizable ideas that work well even at large scale, and form part of a broader research vision that unifies the entire company. We are further looking for individuals with solid engineering skills, that can write bug-free ML code, and can work in the complex code bases behind our state-of-the art AI systems.

You will thrive in this role if you
Are excited about OpenAI's mission and eager to move the needle on a critical component of building safe, beneficial AGI
Are eager to study AI safety through a scientific lens
Have a background in statistical machine learning, physics, mathematics, or another theoretically and empirically rigorous field

As part of our effort to understand the biology of human aging and age-related diseases, we are combining genetic and pharmacological perturbations with high-dimensional readouts such as bulk and single cell sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and microscopy. Information from these experimental platforms has the potential to bridge the gap between real world data from large human cohorts such as the UK Biobank and an actionable understanding of the biological underpinnings of human aging and age-related diseases. However, reconciling these perturbations and diverse read-outs into testable biological hypotheses is a challenging data science problem requiring diverse skill sets, cross-functional collaboration, and a strong grounding in biology.
The Discovery Data Science team contributes to this vision by playing a key role in cross-group research collaborations while developing workflows and methods that improve Calico’s broader scientific capabilities.

Experience conducting systems biological analyses that integrate ‘omics datasets, molecular pathways, and/or genetic data to generate specific testable hypotheses
Fundamental understanding of statistics and biology
Track record of effective interdisciplinary collaboration and a team-first mentality
Must be willing to work onsite four days a week
