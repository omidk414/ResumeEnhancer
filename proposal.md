- Thay Chansy
- Omid Khan

## Key Tasks and Components

### Goals:

1. **Data Collection:** Scrape job posting data from SimplyHired to create a comprehensive dataset of current job requirements.
2. **Data Processing and Analysis:** Clean and analyze the scraped data to identify key skills, qualifications, and trends in job postings.
3. **Model Development:** Train a machine learning model to recognize patterns and important features in job descriptions.
4. **Resume Enhancement:** Develop a system that can analyze an input resume and generate an optimized version based on the trained model and current job market needs.
5. **User Interface:** Create a user-friendly interface for resume submission and enhanced resume delivery.

### Procedure

1. **Web Scraping and Data Collection**
   - Develop a web scraper to collect job postings from SimplyHired.
   - Store the collected data in a CSV file for further processing.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Clean the scraped data, handling missing values and standardizing formats.
   - Extract relevant features from job descriptions (e.g., required skills, experience levels, qualifications).

3. **Machine Learning Model Development**
   - Develop and train a model to identify key features and patterns in job descriptions.
   - Use techniques such as NLP and text classification to categorize job requirements.
   - Implement both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches:
     - Supervised Learning: Train a classifier to categorize job roles and required skills.
     - Unsupervised Learning: Use clustering algorithms to identify patterns in job requirements across different industries.

4. **Resume Analysis System**
   - Create a module to parse and analyze input resumes.
   - Develop a system to compare input resumes against the trained model and job market trends.

5. **Resume Enhancement Generator**
   - Design an algorithm to generate optimized resume content based on the analysis.
   - Implement a template system for formatting the enhanced resume.

6. **User Interface Development**
   - Create a simple web interface for users to upload their resumes and receive enhanced versions.

## Data, Tools, Techniques, and Challenges

### Dataset Description
- Scraped job postings from SimplyHired (target: 10,000+ job listings).
- Features will include job titles, required skills, experience levels, and full job descriptions.

### Tools and Technologies
- Programming Language: Python 3.9+
- Libraries:
  - Web Scraping: Selenium
  - Data Processing: Pandas, logging, time
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow 
  - NLP: NLTK, spaCy
  - Web Framework: Flask 

### Machine Learning Approaches
- Supervised Learning:
  - Classification models for categorizing job roles and skills
  - Regression models for predicting skill importance
- Unsupervised Learning:
  - Clustering algorithms for identifying job market trends
  - Topic modeling for extracting key themes from job descriptions

### Potential Challenges
1. **Ethical Web Scraping:** Ensuring compliance with SimplyHired's terms of service and implementing respectful scraping practices.
2. **Data Quality:** Handling inconsistencies and variations in job posting formats and content.
3. **Model Accuracy:** Developing a model that accurately captures the nuances of different job requirements across various industries.
4. **Resume Parsing:** Creating a robust system to accurately parse and understand diverse resume formats.
5. **Content Generation:** Generating enhanced resume content that is both relevant and natural-sounding.

### Expected Outcomes
1. A functional web scraping system for collecting job posting data.
2. A trained machine learning model capable of analyzing job requirements.
3. A resume enhancement system that can generate optimized resumes.
4. A user-friendly interface for resume submission and retrieval.
5. Improved job application success rates for users of the ResumeEnhancer system.

This proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to creating the ResumeEnhancer system, addressing the key components of data collection, model development, and resume optimization. The project leverages current technologies in web scraping, machine learning, and natural language processing to create a valuable tool for job seekers in today's competitive market.
