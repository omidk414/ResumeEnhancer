    "This notebook demonstrates how to scrape job listings from SimplyHired using Selenium, and how to merge and clean the resulting CSV files. The final output is a single merged dataset containing job information like job title, company name, location, estimated salary, job details, and job links. \n",

    "The `scrape_jobs` function performs web scraping on the SimplyHired website. Given a job title and location, it:\n",
    "- Constructs the URL.\n",
    "- Collects job titles, company names, locations, estimated salaries, job details, and job links.\n",
    "- Handles pagination and error logging.\n",
    "- Saves the data as a CSV file named based on the job title and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Scrapes job listings using Selenium.\n",
    "- Handles multiple pages and collects job details from each job link.\n",
    "- Logs errors to a file (`web_scraping_errors.log`) to help with debugging."
